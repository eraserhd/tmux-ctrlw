  Send kbd:[@ctrlw_key].  e.g. if `@ctrlw_key` is set to kbd:[C-x], then kbd:[C-x] kbd:[x]

Configuration
-------------

`@ctrlw_key` defaults to kbd:[C-w] but can be set to any other key.

`@ctrlw_repl_pane` defaults to `{bottom-right}` but can be set to any tmux pane
identifier.

`@ctrlw_active`
---------------

The user option `@ctrlw_active` is set to 1 when tmux-ctrlw becomes active, 0 when it is finished.
This is useful in formats to highlight pane numbers, for example:

....
set -g pane-border-format "#[fg=#{?@ctrlw_active,#ff5370,#{?pane_active,#292d3e,#697098}}] #P"
....
